These are all the packages necessary for running the Model 1 code.

```

## Loading Data

Before pre=processing the data, we need to load it into a data1 variable for easier 
manipulation. The str() function helps identify which variables in the dataset
are categorical, factors, etc. 

```{r}
data1 <- read.csv("radiomics_completedata.csv", sep = ",")

```

## Preprocessing Data

First, we must check the data for null and missing values. 

```{r}
#Check for null and missing values

which(is.null(data1))

which(is.na(data1))

```

In this case, we have neither missing nor null values. We can proceed to splitting 
the data. 

We want to split the data so that it doesn't include any categorical variables, 
or the Failure column. 

```{r}
#Data split

sub1 <- subset(data1, select= -c(Institution, Failure))

```

Next, we must check if the data has a normal distribution. 
We can do this using two methods: using a histogram and determining visually
if it has a bell curve (meaning data is normalized), or using the Shapiro test
in which if the p-value is < than 0.5, that means that the data is not normally
distributed. 


```{r}
#Check for normality

hist(sub1$GLNU_align.H.PET)

```

```{r}


sub1shapiro <- shapiro.test(sub1$GLNU_align.H.PET)
sub1shapiro

```

In this case, the histogram doesn't show us a bell curve, and the p-value
from the Shapiro test is < 0.5, meaning data is not distributed normally. 

We must perform data normalization using the scale() function. Once done, 
to check if data is normalized, we can use the summary() function to see if the 
mean is = 0 and use the sd() function to see if the standard deviation is = 1.


```{r}


#Normalize Data

scale_data <-  as.data.frame(scale(sub1, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE))

summary(scale_data$GLNU_align.H.PET)
sd(scale_data$GLNU_align.H.PET)

```

Now the data has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, meaning the data is normalized.

We then check correlation of the full dataset without the categorical variables:

```{r}

cor1 <- cor(select(scale_data, -c(Failure.binary)))
#cor1 this has been commented out or else there would be 700 pages in the pdf

```

### Dataset Training and Testing Split

With preprocessing done, we can split the training and testing dataset. For this,
we begin by factoring the Failure.binary column, and transforming the levels
so that they represent Failure and Success. This is important for KNN and Decision
Trees.

For memory purposes and faster processing, we split the dataframe to take only a 
"sample" of the full dataset, or just the 50 first columns. The training is split
at 80%, using Failure.binary as the output.

```{r}

scale_data$Failure.binary <- factor(data1$Failure.binary)


#data1 <- select(scale_data, -c("Institution", "Failure"))

data1 <- select(scale_data, 1:50)

levels(data1$Failure.binary) <- c("Failure", "Success")


df <- data1

str(df)

# Create training (80%) and test (20%) sets for the 
set.seed(123)  # for reproducibility
churn_split <- initial_split(df, prop = 0.8, strata = "Failure.binary")
churn_train <- training(churn_split)
churn_test  <- testing(churn_split)

```

### Model 1: Linear Regression

The first model we will look at is Linear Regression.

First, we train 3 different models. 

```{r}

#Model training
 set.seed(123)
 cv_model1 <- train(
   Failure.binary ~ H_suv.PET, 
   data = churn_train, 
   method = "glm",
   family = "binomial",
   trControl = trainControl(method = "cv", number = 5)
   )

set.seed(123)
cv_model2 <- train(
   Failure.binary ~ Entropy_cooc.W.ADC + GLNU_align.H.PET,
   data = churn_train,
   method = "glm",
   family = "binomial",
   trControl = trainControl(method = "cv", number = 5)

 )

 set.seed(123)
 cv_model3 <- train(
   Failure.binary ~ .,  #overall datasets
   data = churn_train,
   method = "glm",
   family = "binomial",
   trControl = trainControl(method = "cv", number = 5)
 )
 
```

Then we extract the sample performance measures:

```{r}

# extract out of sample performance measures
summary(
  resamples(
    list(
      model1 = cv_model1,
      model2 = cv_model2,
      model3 = cv_model3
    )
  )
)$statistics$Accuracy


```
As seen above, model 2 has the best results. As a whole, model 1 is the weakest
(Final.binary on its own).

Next, we create the prediction classes for each model and their confusion matrices.

Because we changed the levels for Faliure.binary to "Failure" and "Success"
we need to change the reference parameters to that.


```{r}


# predict class
pred_class_1 <- predict(cv_model1, churn_train)


#balanced accuracy is most important

# create confusion matrix
confusionMatrix(
  data = relevel(pred_class_1, ref = "Success"), 
  reference = relevel(churn_train$Failure.binary, ref = "Success")
)

pred_class_2 <- predict(cv_model2, churn_train)

# create confusion matrix
confusionMatrix(
  data = relevel(pred_class_2, ref = "Success"), 
  reference = relevel(churn_train$Failure.binary, ref = "Success")
)

pred_class_3 <- predict(cv_model3, churn_train)

# create confusion matrix
confusionMatrix(
  data = relevel(pred_class_3, ref = "Success"), 
  reference = relevel(churn_train$Failure.binary, ref = "Success")
)


# Compute predicted probabilities on training data
m1_prob <- predict(cv_model1, churn_train, type = "prob")$Success
m2_prob <- predict(cv_model2, churn_train, type = "prob")$Success
m3_prob <- predict(cv_model3, churn_train, type = "prob")$Success



# Compute AUC metrics for cv_model1,2 and 3 
perf1 <- prediction(m1_prob, churn_train$Failure.binary) %>%
  performance(measure = "tpr", x.measure = "fpr")
perf2 <- prediction(m2_prob, churn_train$Failure.binary) %>%
  performance(measure = "tpr", x.measure = "fpr")
perf3 <- prediction(m3_prob, churn_train$Failure.binary) %>%
  performance(measure = "tpr", x.measure = "fpr")

# Plot ROC curves for cv_model1,2 and 3 
plot(perf1, col = "black", lty = 2)
plot(perf2,  add = TRUE, col = "red", lty = 2)
plot(perf3, add = TRUE, col = "blue")
legend(0.7, 0.3, legend = c("cv_model1", "cv_model2", "cv_model3"),
       col = c("black","red", "blue"), lty = 3:1, cex = 0.6)

# ROC plot for training data
roc(churn_train$Failure.binary ~ m1_prob, plot=TRUE, legacy.axes=FALSE, 
    percent=TRUE, col="black", lwd=2, print.auc=TRUE)
plot.roc(churn_train$Failure.binary ~ m2_prob,  percent=TRUE, col="red", 
         lwd=2, print.auc=TRUE, add=TRUE, print.auc.y=40)
plot.roc(churn_train$Failure.binary ~ m3_prob,  percent=TRUE, col="blue", 
         lwd=2, print.auc=TRUE, add=TRUE, print.auc.y=30)
title(main = "Model Performance during Training", line = 2.5)


#Feature Interpretation
vip(cv_model3, num_features = 20)

# Compute predicted probabilities on test data
m1_prob <- predict(cv_model1, churn_test, type = "prob")$Success
m2_prob <- predict(cv_model2, churn_test, type = "prob")$Success
m3_prob <- predict(cv_model3, churn_test, type = "prob")$Success

# Compute AUC metrics for cv_model1,2 and 3 
perf1 <- prediction(m1_prob, churn_test$Failure.binary) %>%
  performance(measure = "tpr", x.measure = "fpr")
perf2 <- prediction(m2_prob, churn_test$Failure.binary) %>%
  performance(measure = "tpr", x.measure = "fpr")
perf3 <- prediction(m3_prob, churn_test$Failure.binary) %>%
  performance(measure = "tpr", x.measure = "fpr")

# Plot ROC curves for cv_model1,2 and 3 
plot(perf1, col = "black", print.auc=TRUE, lty = 2)
plot(perf2,  add = TRUE, col = "red",  print.auc=TRUE, lty = 2)
plot(perf3, add = TRUE, col = "blue", print.auc=TRUE)
legend(0.7, 0.3, legend = c("cv_model1", "cv_model2", "cv_model3"),
       col = c("black","red", "blue"), lty = 3:1, cex = 0.6)

# ROC plot for testing data
roc(churn_test$Failure.binary ~ m1_prob, plot=TRUE, legacy.axes=FALSE, 
    percent=TRUE, col="black", lwd=2, print.auc=TRUE)
plot.roc(churn_test$Failure.binary ~ m2_prob,  percent=TRUE, col="red", 
         lwd=2, print.auc=TRUE, add=TRUE, print.auc.y=40)
plot.roc(churn_test$Failure.binary ~ m3_prob,  percent=TRUE, col="blue", 
         lwd=2, print.auc=TRUE, add=TRUE, print.auc.y=30)
title(main = "Model Performance during Testing", line = 2.5)


legend("topright", c("Model 1", "Model 2", "Model 3"), lty=1, 
    col = c("black", "red", "blue"), bty="n")

```

As seen in the ROC graph, Model 2 performs in an outstancing manner of distinguishing failures and successes, whereas model 3, in which Failure.binary as a whole performs on the entire dataset, still performs at an excellent level. Model 1, technically, shouldn't really be considered.


### Model 2: KNN

Here we are creating a second model using KNN. The grid search on my computer takes about 5-7 minutes with a sample size of 50 variables. Again, reference points for prediction is "Success".


```{r}
#------Blueprint-------------------------------------------#

blueprint_attr <- recipe(Failure.binary ~ ., data = churn_train) %>%
  step_nzv(all_nominal()) %>%
  step_integer(contains("Entropy")) %>%
  step_integer(contains("GLNU")) %>%
  step_dummy(all_nominal(), -all_outcomes(), one_hot = TRUE) %>%
  step_center(all_numeric(), -all_outcomes()) %>%
  step_scale(all_numeric(), -all_outcomes())

#-----------Resampling Method----------------------------#

cv <- trainControl(
  method = "repeatedcv", 
  number = 10, 
  repeats = 5,
  classProbs = TRUE,                 
  summaryFunction = twoClassSummary)
#-------Hyperparameters and Gridsearch---------------------------#

hyper_grid <- expand.grid(
  k = floor(seq(1, nrow(churn_train)/3, length.out = 20))
)

# Fit knn model and perform grid search
knn_grid <- train(
  blueprint_attr, 
  data = churn_train, 
  method = "knn", 
  trControl = cv, 
  tuneGrid = hyper_grid,
  metric = "ROC"
)

ggplot(knn_grid)


#----------Variable Importance----------------#

varimpo <- varImp(knn_grid)
varimpo

pred_knngrid <- predict(knn_grid, churn_train)

confusionMatrix(
  data = relevel(pred_knngrid, ref = "Success"), 
  reference = relevel(churn_train$Failure.binary, ref = "Success")
)


ggplot(varimpo)


par(mfrow = c(1,2))



# § Plot the training data performance while print the AUC values.


knngrid_prob <- predict(knn_grid, churn_train, type = "prob")$Success
roc(churn_train$Failure.binary ~ knngrid_prob, plot=TRUE, legacy.axes=FALSE, 
    percent=TRUE, col="black", lwd=2, print.auc=TRUE)
title(main = "Model Performance during Training", line = 2.5)


# § Use the PREDICT function to predict using the testing data.

knntest <- predict(knn_grid, churn_test)
confusionMatrix(
  data = relevel(knntest, ref = "Success"), 
  reference = relevel(churn_test$Failure.binary, ref = "Success")
)
                              
# § Plot the testing data performance while print the AUC values.

knngrid_probtest <- predict(knn_grid, churn_test, type = "prob")$Success
roc(churn_test$Failure.binary ~ knngrid_probtest, plot=TRUE, legacy.axes=FALSE, 
    percent=TRUE, col="black", lwd=2, print.auc=TRUE)
title(main = "Model Performance during Testing", line = 2.5)

```
The training data performance is just a little better than testing, but the AUC values for both aren't as good as the ones from LR.


### Model 3: Decision Tree

```{r}

##modeling
fit <- rpart(Failure.binary~., data = churn_train, method = 'class')

#plotting
rpart.plot(fit, extra = 100)

#plotting
plotcp(fit)

#feature importance
vip(fit, num_features = 20, bar = FALSE)

# Compute predicted probabilities on training data
dt1_prob <- predict(fit, churn_train, type = "prob")

# ROC plot for training data
roc(churn_train$Failure.binary ~ dt1_prob[,2], plot=TRUE, legacy.axes=FALSE, 
    percent=TRUE, col="black", lwd=2, print.auc=TRUE)


test_fit <- rpart(Failure.binary~., data = churn_test, method = 'class')
failure_predict <- predict(test_fit,churn_test)


#    Use the RPART.PLOT and PLOTCP function to identify the trees
rpart.plot(test_fit, extra =  100)
plotcp(test_fit)

#    Plot the testing data performance while print the AUC values


dt2_prob <- predict(test_fit, churn_test, type = "prob")

perf1 <- prediction(dt2_prob[,2], churn_test$Failure.binary) %>%
  performance(measure = "tpr", x.measure = "fpr")
plot(perf1, col = "black", lty = 2)

roc(churn_test$Failure.binary ~ dt2_prob[,2], plot=TRUE, legacy.axes=FALSE, 
    percent=TRUE, col="black", lwd=2, print.auc=TRUE)

```

The Decision Tree ROC curves and AUC values are excellent considering both training and testing are over 90%.



### Conclusion

Based on the above AUC results, KNN has performed the least well compared to both Linear Regression and Decision Tree. If we consider the ROC models that had Failure.binary be predicted against the full (sampled) dataset, Decision Tree had the highest accuracy.
